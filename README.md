This command line app can tell the current date, yesterday's date and tomorrow's date, by simply following the commands listed in the **Three Distinct Responses**. I chose **Luxon** due to its ease of use and it is perfect for my goal which is the ability to present dates in the command line. I also chose Luxon because of its ease of use, the documentation is easy to navigate and understand.

## Problems

- One of the problems I encountered is setting my timezone to a shorter version.
